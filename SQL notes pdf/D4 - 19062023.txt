ANALYSIS SERVICES (SSAS):
-- Creation of cubes with data marts/data warehouses for insightful and quicker data analysis
-- Two major alternatives â€“ Multidimensional (for corporate analytics) and Tabular (for personal and team analytics)
-- Mostly used in Data Warehousing environment


REPORTING SERVICES (SSRS):
-- Faster processing of reports on both relational and multidimensional data
-- SSRS allows reports to be exported in different formats. You can deliver SSRS reports using emails
-- SSRS provides a host of security features, which helps you to control, who can access which report


INTERGRATION SERVICES (SSIS):
-- SSIS is a fast & flexible data warehousing tool used for data extraction, loading and transformation like cleaning, aggregating, merging data, etc.
--It makes it easy to move data from one database to another database. SSIS can extract data from a wide variety of sources like SQL Server databases, Excel files, Oracle and DB2 databases, etc.

								SERVER NAME
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Servername is nothing but Instance Name given to your SQLServer instance
-- For default instance, it would be same as the Server Name or the Machine Name
-- For named instance, it would be ServerName\InstanceName or MachineName\InstanceName
-- You can also use IPAddress instead of ServerName




								AUTHENTICATION

There are two authentication modes in SQL Server using which you can login and connect with the SQL Server.

1. WINDOWS Authentications:
-- Windows authentication mode enables local Windows authentication with SQL Server, where you can login with your local Windows credentials.
	
	
2. SERVER Authentication:
-- Database administrators create SQL logins and provide appropriate permissions for users to authenticate themselves to SQL Server. Users need to specify the login and password while connecting to SQL Server
