		// Why String is Immutable In Nature :
		
		// Strings once created its created we cant replace or mute it 
		
		// Strings uses concept called string pool which makes it as immutable 
		
		//  Whenever you are creating a varaible values which is already created mapping for your varaible in string pool is changed 
		
		//  New memory will not be allocated for the existing memory it self
